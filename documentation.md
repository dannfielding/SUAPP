# Introduction
This documentation looks in the design process followed whilst creating a single page web application to increase university experience for students, it looks at different design theory and follows an iterative methodology to implement improvements over time based on the feedback given by students.

# Methodology
The design methodology that was used for this project is an iterative method. The reasoning behind this decision comes down to the factor of it allowing for designs to be improved over time as a project progresses instead of in one big increment (https://doi.org/10.1109/2.241424). The methodology works by using a cycle, there are many different cycles that can be followed whilst using this methodology although they all follow the same concept which is a planning stage, prototype stage, implementation stage and feedback stage. These stages will be further discussed as the project progress to each of them. The process continues for as many cycles as needed until the design is good enough. This can be seen further below where the designs are tested against a user base. This project aims to improve an aspect of the current e-learning platform provided to students by the university. Based on a survey conducted on 22 participants who are university students, an area that could be improved was identified these were accessibility of contact information, deadlines, feedback and grades. This survey was reconducted since the last assignment due to not gaining the necessary information for main areas of concern. The survey allowed for points of improvement to be identified and for the planning of a solution to begin, because the points concern accessibility of information research into theories that can help layout information better in design would need to be researched.

### Results

Research into what design theories could be utilised within the project was conducted. The theory that made the most sense to follow was Gestalt’s principles (https://doi.org/10.2190/G748-BY68-L83T-X02J) which are 7 different design principles that should be taken into consideration when designing for the web. By using the principles users would be able to easily navigate around the application due to it being designed following psychological principles of how users perceive information that is proven to improve design quality. The main principles the application will utilise are proximity, common fate, similarity and symmetry, these principles will be explained when justifying the design choices made within the application.

Another design aspect that will be utilised to enhance the application is the use of whitespace (https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/the-power-of-white-space). Whitespace is the area surrounding elements on a page, it directs users to focus on important information on a page. Using whitespace within the design will allow for user’s eyes to be directed towards specific parts of important information, for example, their grades. Using these design theories will allow for the minimal design wanted during this project, this comes down to wanting students to easily be able to navigate the application and using these methods will allow for this to happen by direct user’s attention towards certain key points.

The planning stage started by looking into trying to find a solution to the proposed problem. Planning started and a solution to the student’s problem which is assignment information not being easily accessible could be brainstorm. The solution needed to ensure that students are able to easily access the information that they need without having to click through lots of pages. The idea that came to mind was to create a new application that had better navigation so students could easily move around the application and to display only the key information that they need on the pages important to them. This was mean only displaying the information if a student needs it, so a way of only displaying the information when interacted with needs to designed. The two ways of doing this that would solve the problem are collapsible menus and hover effects both of these will allow for information to be hidden until a user either clicks or hovers over a certain part of the page. Combining this functionality with the design theory researched previously should solve the problem of students not being able to access information easily.

# Design, Implimentation and Testing
## First Design Iteration - Low Fidelity
The prototype stage of the project started with the creation of some low-fidelity wireframes that would allow for the frame of the application to be conceptualised. The application was designed to have 6 different pages these being a login, dashboard, assignments, feedback & grades and contacts page. This allows students to access the information that they want through a low number of pages. At this stage, the wireframes were used to gain an idea of the general layout of the application. Although they followed the design theories discussed earlier so that the application, later on, could be easily navigated and specific points of it could stick out using different techniques. Some of these techniques can only be executed during the high-fidelity wireframes due to the inclusion of colour, so the ones that could be used were utilised during the low-fidelity. The wireframes were created digitally and would allow for an idea of what the medium-fidelity wireframes would look like, no testing was conducted on the low fidelity it was just created to gain an idea of what the application would look like.

## Second Design Iteration - Medium Fidelity v1
Medium fidelity is where a user base was introduced to gain feedback as part of the new iterations of the design. The difference between the low and medium fidelity is that the pages are populated with information this time whereas before they were populated with placeholder text, this allows for a better idea of what the application will look like and where the information will be stored. The medium-fidelity wireframes survey was sent to 20 different participants to gain feedback on if students liked the navigation of the design. It should be noted that the wireframes were turned into a clickable prototype. The results showed that students liked the navigation, although the students would prefer it if the grades and feedback page was merged into the assignments page so the important information could be found on one page instead of two. It also showed that the students liked how the assignments were in a list where they can be easily accessed.

### Results

## Third Design Iteration - Medium Fidelity v2
Using the information from the survey the second iteration of the medium-fidelity designs could take place, this time changes to where the grades and feedback information was stored was changed to feature on the assignments page. The biggest change was the introduction of colour into the wireframes. When selecting the colours, research into what the university uses for its colours was conducted and this was found to be a white and red scheme. It was then decided that the application would also follow similar colours although focusing more on red than white. As the application would be connected to the university it should follow a similar scheme to make it feel connected. The survey was sent out to 20 participants although only 15 responded this time, it asked the students if the liked the proposed colour scheme, the grades and feedback information now featuring on the assignments page and are there any improvements that can be made to the design. The results from the survey were really positive the students really liked the colour scheme, the changes to the assignments page were accepted as a good and the only improvements that were suggested concerned the size of text and the addition of being able to see the deadline of an assignment and when a previous assignment was handed in.

### Results

A new logo was designed to increase the user experience, this also comes down to the factor of the current logo used on the e-learning is dull. The process for designing the logo was to sketch some basic ideas based on the university name and allow for students to choose the logo which they believe looks the best. Thirteen different logos were sketched and then uploaded to a survey which asked students which logo they liked the most, out of the 22 participants the logo chosen to be developed was logo 5.

### Results

## Final Design Iteration - Hi-Fidelity
Moving forward the medium-fidelity designs were changed and made into the high fidelity these featured images, updated text sizes, more information and would be the final iteration of the design phase. The wireframes were sent out to 10 participants to make sure the design was good enough to be developed. The results showed the students liked the design and it was ready to be developed into an actual application. The questions in the survey were, do you as the colour scheme used, is information found on each page useful, is the application easy to navigate, what do you like about the prototype and what do you think could be improved in the prototype. The survey results showed that the students were happy with the current design as navigation was easy and they were provided with the information they needed so development could begin.

### Results

## Design Justification
The final design incorporated many of gestalt’s principles the best example of this is headings and subheadings which are different shades of red, this informs the users which boxes are headings and which are subheadings. This follows the similarity principle, although they look similar users can easily see that these two are part of two different groups. The majority of the pages were designed to follow symmetry to provide an order of what is being displayed to users, although asymmetry was also used as well because it allows for key parts of pages to stick out of the symmetrical design, this can be seen within the dashboard where the upcoming events section and welcome message aren’t symmetrical to each other this is because users should be directed towards the each of these items separately. The best example of symmetry is the way that the application follows a very strict one column design which means that everything is displayed within a list and is nicely ordered. The user’s eyes shouldn’t stray away from the center of their screen which means they are directed to look at a certain point of the page at all times. This works well with the collapsible menus as the list is quite short so navigation up and down the application is quick and easy, whereas if the information was already displayed it could take longer to navigate through all the text.

The collapsible sections were used so information could be hidden until students required it, this leads to a simple page layout that’s still packed with vital information, which is easy to navigate due to less content on the screen and improves user experience as users are able to interact with the page. This featured within the assignments page which would display users an assignment name and once clicked would reveal further information about a specific assignment. Although it may be seen as bad to hide information from the users, using white space users can be directed towards looking at the assignment names so they could easily scroll through the list of assignments and view the assignment they wanted to access. As realistically they may only want to view the information of one assignment not all of them.

Information is further hidden again this is when hovering over the grades bar chart which allows students to see the past 7 grades they’ve received in the form of a simple bar chart. It may seem like a static bar chart but upon hovering over any of the grade text users are provided with the assignment name, percentage they received when they received the grade. Not only does it look good but its further bulks up the amount of information stored within the page. The bar chart uses white space and allows for users to be directed towards the chart as the grades are an important part of this page. Not only does the chart use white space it also uses proximity to show the user that each bar is part of the same group.

Whitespace was used throughout the application especially on the login page as users should be directed towards the login interface. This can also be seen within the profile page where the users focus it directed towards their profile picture and personal information, as this contains useful information that students may need so that’s where they should be directed first. The notable information to be taken away from the design is that it seeks to be minimal to reduce the amount of information being displayed to the user unless they want to see it, the application should be easy to navigate and being minimal is the way that this can be solved by the use of different design theories.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, a single page web application that follows an iterative design methodology was created based on two different design theories that helped shape the application. Although the main influence came from the students who provided the data needed to create an application that would help them in their everyday lives.
