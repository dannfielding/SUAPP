This project looks into the process of designing and prototyping a single page web application using React.js. It looks into the design process from sketching wireframes and logos to digitally creating hi-fidelity wireframes to creating a single page web application based on these designs. This will document the design choices made in terms of colours, fonts, images and logos and will look into the methodology followed throughout the project. It looks into the testing of the finished web application and whether students would like to use the application if it was further developed and would look at the reasoning behind design choices.

An agile methodology was chosen when the project started, the reasoning behind this is it allows for a lot feedback from the clients in this situation it’s students. The project started out by looking at the current system of the university, this included the good and the bad parts of it. Using this information, the project was able start and it started with gaining information from students about what parts of their e-learning portal they liked. This survey was conducted in the previous report and would help start the project properly.  After much consideration it was decided that assessment, grades and feedback would be the primary focus of what would be created and improved. This completes the first section of the agile methodology which was to learn what the users want. Using the information gained above user stories were created for different tasks, this would allow for when creating the web application clear goals to be seen which can be worked towards. The first user story created was so “As a student, I want to be able to see my upcoming assignments and previous assignments with grades so it’s easy to see when login to the application.”. The second user story was “As a student, I want to be a easy to navigate application so I can access the information I need when I need it.”. The last user story was “As a student I want to be able to see clear descriptions of my assignments, progress bar that show how close I am to finishing and when the assignment is due and how many days I have left to complete it.”.

Using user stories hi-fidelity designs started to be created, the shell of what the web application would look like started to come together five pages were created these being login, dashboard, profile, assignment and grades and feedback. The login page would allow for users to input their university email and password and the dashboard contains announcements, upcoming deadlines and grades although this is a glimpse of what will be displayed on the grades and feedback page. The profile page contains an image of the user, university year, email, average grade and current/previous assignments. The assignments page shows the users current assignments, a progress bar, a checklist, when the assignment is due and how long the user has. Finally, the grades and feedback page display previous assignments, when it was submitted, when the grade/feedback was released, the grade and feedback given by a lecturer. Along with these pages is a burger menu was designed for navigation around these pages. Once these pages were designed it was time to choose colours, fonts and font sizes. Looking into the university it’s clear to see that they like using the colours red and white, so to follow this trend set by the university the colours used were red, white and black. The red features in the menu, header and footer, where the white is used as the background, some text and the logo and the black was used only text on the white background.

After the bulk of the hi-fidelity wireframes were complete A logo for the designs needed to be created. It was decided that rough sketches would be drawn to create some simple ideas which later on could be developed digitally into a logo which will feature of the single page web application. As the university is called Solent University it felt right to base the logos off of that. The thirteen logo sketches which can be seen below look into combining the universities name and the word app, this would provide a simple but good-looking logo in the end. Once the sketches were complete a survey was created to gain feedback on which logo students believed look the best, out of 22 participants logo five received the most votes. Using this information, the development of the logo digitally started and after a good amount of time a high-quality logo was complete. Upon applying this logo to the hi-fidelity it was found that the logo was too long in height so another logo was created specifically for the header, this removed the red line and allowed for the logo to fit within the header bar. The original logo created would still be used on the login page and within the menu. 

 

Using all of the designs created above a style guide was created so when the application is being developed it can be used as a reference of what font size, font, images and colours to use. This is useful as it means that the web applications styling will be consistent.
 
Before the web application would be developed feedback on the created wireframes, logo and colour scheme was needed to ensure the target audience were getting what they wanted. A survey was sent to 20 participants which showed them the wireframes of each page and the style guide. There were 6 questions, these being do you like the page design and the information you’d be able to access from it? Five of these questions were created one for each of the pages and the last question asking if they liked the style guide. The results were very positive these can be seen here: 


The web applications navigation was designed to be smooth using a method transitioning users between views using animation to increase and decrease opacity to create a transition between pages that looks nice and improves user experience, before navigation was jagged and didn’t flow nicely. The reasoning behind using the transitions was to make the application flow nicely and provide users with a smooth way of navigating the application it also makes it feel like they’re not leaving the application when views change as they fade in to views rather than change suddenly. The navigation allows for the menu to be tucked away behind an icon and accessed when a user clicks it allowing users to access all of the information without a navigation bar being in the way, the new menu provides users with better navigation options compared to current menu available that’s confusing as it doesn’t provide students with links directly to the information they need whereas this navigation does.
The profile page allows users view information about themselves such as average grade, email, current year, current assignments and previous assignments. The reasoning behind this information being featured is all of the most important information should be stored on their profile page where they can clearly see it. This especially important concerning the average grade as this isn’t currently something that the current application provides students. Information such email, year and address were hidden behind a hover which allows for the page to be less cluttered and display the information that students are interested in such as average grade, this design choice means that the page still has lots of important information but only the really important is constantly displayed. The grades and feedback page also use a hover function to display information, this is to keep the page clean and uncluttered so students can easily navigate through their previous assignments. When hovering over a text box that says “View Grade and Feedback” a box is displayed that shows users their grade and feedback. The current application available to students required lots of navigation for them to view feedback and grades of all of their assignments by incorporating all of their assignments into one page where the information was presented to them in a simple form solves this problem and saves time.
The thought behind these designs was to provided information in a much friendlier format cutting out information and features that students don’t really need and providing them with a better vibrant design than the current method of students being able to access this information, the current design which follows a very dull black and white colour scheme doesn’t match the university colours, has an outdated logo which reads “Solent Online Learning” and it cluttered with information that many students don’t need. It can be assumed, the new web application provided an easier experience with better design this is so because of the information collected in the previous report students were able to say issues they have with the current application, taking the data into account the new web application has taken what they liked about the old application and used it and removed the features and information they didn’t use or like. A great deal of time went into designing this application from creating the wireframes, logo and style guide to make sure that the design looks good and has what students want. The design was inspired by the current university colours mainly the red and white to allow for users to feel like the application is connected to the university the currently application doesn’t have this feeling, the new design is simple and does what students want.

Testing started off with seeing if the user stories requirements had been met. The first one concerning assignment displayed with grades was successful, students are able to access this information quickly. The second looked into making sure students were able to navigate the site quickly and easily, this was fulfilled due to the navigation menu which displays important pages to students. The last user story was allowing students to see a clear description of assignments and progress bar to see how close they are to finishing it, this was completed too. Although this isn’t the most practical way of testing it allows to see if the goal of the project is met. The application was further tested using a test plan, a test plan would allow for any issues concerning functionality to be identified, the main buttons and animation were tested and documented in a table.  
The web application was then tested by 5 participants who were happy to test the application this was made sure before they tested, to see what they thought about the design. They were all asked to just freely use the application for a few minutes so they were able to interact with the application. After a few minutes they were asked the following questions, did you like the colour scheme, was the navigation quick and easy to use, did you find the hover functions useful, are there improvements that can be made to the design of the application and would you use this over the current SOL application. All of the participants liked the colour scheme of the application and believed. Two participants said that the navigation was slow sometimes in terms of components loading on pages although the other said that it was quick and easy to use. The hover functions received mixed reviews as some students believed that they were useful and other would have preferred the information to be shown without having to hover. The main improvements given about the design concern more functionality in views such as the dashboard as there is no way of users interacting on the page and for navigation to be better optimised. Four out of the five participants said that they would use the new application over the current application if it was further developed. Although this is a small sample it gives a view into whether the design was good or not.
